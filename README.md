# Football-Dribbler

## Overview
Football Dribbler is an engaging 2D football-themed game where players control a soccer ball from a top-down perspective on a football field. The goal is to maneuver the ball past defenders and score goals by swiping across the screen. The game combines elements of strategy, skill, and quick reflexes to provide a challenging and entertaining experience.

## Gameplay
- Control Mechanism: Players control the soccer ball by swiping on the screen. The direction and speed of the swipe determine the ball's movement.
- Objective: Navigate the ball past oncoming defenders and score a goal at the opponent's gate.
- Scoring: Points are awarded based on how quickly the player scores a goal. The faster the goal is scored, the higher the points awarded.
- Game Over: The game ends immediately if the ball collides with any defender. A game over panel is displayed, and the player can choose to retry.
- Reset Mechanism: Upon scoring a goal or colliding with a defender, the game resets. The ball returns to its starting position, defenders reset to their initial positions, and a countdown of 3, 2, 1 starts before resuming play.

## Additional Features
- Defender Movement: Defenders move vertically along the y-axis within a range of -2 to 2 units, making the game more challenging.
- Goalkeeper: The goalkeeper moves vertically within a specified range, providing an additional layer of difficulty for scoring goals.
- High Score Tracking: The game tracks the highest score achieved by the player and displays it alongside the current score.
- Scene Transitions: Players can navigate between the "Home" scene and the "Play" scene. The game ensures all elements reset and initialize properly when transitioning between scenes.
- User Interface: The game includes intuitive UI elements for score display, high score tracking, and start/retry options.
